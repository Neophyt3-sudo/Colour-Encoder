# Colour-Encoder
###Description
This is my attempt to create an encoder which is a part of much 
bigger project I've got in mind which is machine learning. 

You input the encoder, and it prints out whether it's:
* green, 
* blue, or
* neither.

###Scraper.py

Scraper.py is a part of my project to 'stress-test' my main.py 
script, looping through and printing the outcome shown above. 
The exported data can also be reused for machine learning.
